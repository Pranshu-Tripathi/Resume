\section*{Experience}

\experience{Schrödinger (D.E. Shaw)}{Hyderabad}{Developer 2 (SDE-2)}{07/2024 -- Present}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Prototyped a voice-enabled LLM agent (Maestro Assistant) using Vertex AI, Google Speech-to-Text, and LITELLM; now leading backend dev with 2 reports.
    \item Reduced non-bonded interaction time 300-400x by building a modular C++ library with caching; cut 10-min tasks to 30s.
    \item Designed and deployed LLM agent backend with FastAPI, G Cloud Run, Docker, G Cloud SQL, and Terraform for production-ready models.
    \item Implemented a bidirectional communication layer between Maestro and PyMOL using the Mediator design pattern, reducing integration complexity by 40\% and improving system modularity.
    \item Enhanced export functionality for new movie presets (e.g., View Ligand Docking) from Maestro to PyMOL, decreasing manual visualization setup time by 60\% and enhancing automated workflow efficiency.
    \item Refactored 2000+ lines of legacy code using Factory and Strategy patterns, improving extensibility for handling diverse Job Server outputs.
    \item Implemented caching in the interaction library, enabling $<$1-second repeated lookups and making the tool reusable across Schrödinger's software suite.
\end{itemize}

\experience{Schrödinger (D.E. Shaw)}{Hyderabad}{Developer 1 (SDE-1)}{06/2023 -- 06/2024}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Redesigned DAO interface in Maestro using Bridge and Adapter patterns, enabling support for 12+ new APIs across all structure properties.
    \item Created an adapter for Schrödinger's structure class that removed the m2io dependency and enabled a property-writing mechanism with 3x greater flexibility.
    \item Improved collaboration across teams by decoupling write logic, enabling 3+ new writing strategies and earning recognition from the Scientific Infrastructure team.
    \item Identified and fixed 20+ legacy code bugs, resulting in 2x faster job file incorporation and improved stability across Maestro workflows.
    \item Co-implemented a Vulkan-based rendering engine, replacing OpenGL to enhance 3D graphics performance and GPU efficiency in Maestro.
\end{itemize}
